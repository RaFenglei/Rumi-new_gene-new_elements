# Rumi-new gene&new elements

This repository contains tutorials and workflows for identifying new genes and new elements in ruminants by integrating comparative genomics with multi-omics approaches, including bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and spatial-RNA-ATAC-seq data. The primary focus is on identifying new genes, new elements, and Structural Variations (SVs) within Ruminantia, Pecora, and Cervidae for:

- Identify new genes, regulatory elements, and structural variations (SVs) specific to various families within the Ruminantia suborder.
- Identify new genes, regulatory elements, and SVs potentially playing crucial roles in the origin and development of ruminant-specific organs such as the rumen, headgears, and omasum.
- Identify new genes, regulatory elements, and SVs potentially involved in important ruminant-specific traits, such as body size and rumen methanogenesis.

Based on the prior work of **Haorong Li** and **Zihe Li**, this work was completed collaboratively by **Fenglei Zhang** (Master) in during 2025-2026 at the [School of Ecology and Environment](https://see.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of **Prof. [Wen Wang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/0147C7EFF01849A49FF04A590BCCBC58.html)**, , and **Prof. [Ruiwen Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2025010081.html)**.
