# PMCs-Specific-Marker Applications

This repository contains tutorials and workflows for identifying specific markers of Periosteal Mesenchymal Cells (PMCs) during antler regeneration using multi-omics approaches, including bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and scRNA-seq data. The primary focus is on identifying PMC2-specific markers and key factors for:

- Inducing PMC2 to PMC4 conversion
- Inducing human MSCs to deer ABPC-like cells

This work was completed collaboratively by **Fenglei Zhang** (Master) and **Jinrui Ma** (PhD candidate) in July and August 2025 at the [School of Ecology and Environment](https://see.nwpu.edu.cn/), [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of **Prof. [Wen Wang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/0147C7EFF01849A49FF04A590BCCBC58.html)**, **Prof. [Tongtong Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2024010091.html)**, and **Prof. [Ruiwen Zhang](https://see.nwpu.edu.cn/szdw1/js/1.htm)**.
